== Customizing the AMQP ConnectionFactory

If you are using AMQP there needs to be a `ConnectionFactory` (from
Spring Rabbit) in the application context. If there is a single
`ConnectionFactory` it will be used, or if there is a one qualified as
`@BusConnectionFactory` it will be preferred over others, otherwise
the `@Primary` one will be used. If there are multiple unqualified
connection factories there will be an error.

Note that Spring Boot (as of 1.2.2) creates a `ConnectionFactory` that
is _not_ `@Primary`, so if you want to use one connection factory for
the bus and another for business messages, you need to create both,
and annotate them `@BusConnectionFactory` and `@Primary` respectively.
